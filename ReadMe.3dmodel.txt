#ReadMe 3d-model

The Basic 3d-model (fuselage, wings, gear, control surfaces, UVmapping) for the Tornado was started at 2008/09 just for practicing.
Due missing spare time it ended until late 2011 when the SUZ (System Support Center Tornado - Cassidian/EADS) at Manching/ Germany requested the 3d-model for their 
new Mission Debriefing Software for the german Tornado Crews.

So in 2012 german Tornado Crews will see the same basic 3d-model (without our weapons and gear) used here for the OpenSource FlightSimulator FlightGear in their Mission Debriefing Software!
	
Due to its age the model itself isn't the best example of a clean mesh, (tail....) but the shape and the proportions are highly accurate
and correct.

This 3d-model is released under GNU GPL.
